# Transport-Mode-Prediction-Deal-Outcome
## üöç Transport Mode Prediction & ü¶à Shark Tank Deal Outcome Analysis
This repository presents two applied machine learning projects that combine classification modeling and natural language processing (NLP) for real-world decision-making.

üîπ Project 1: Transport Mode Prediction
Predicts employees' preferred mode of transportation (public vs. private) based on demographic and work-related features using multiple classification algorithms. Developed for a transport service provider working with ABC Consulting.

Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and multivariate visualization

Data preprocessing with outlier treatment and standard scaling

Classification models: Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC-ROC

Best Model: Gradient Boosting (AUC: 0.938, Accuracy: 86%)

üîπ Project 2: Shark Tank Pitch Text Mining
Analyzes 495 entrepreneurial pitches from Shark Tank to identify linguistic patterns associated with investment outcomes using text mining and word cloud visualization.

Key Features:
NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, text length analysis)

Deal vs. No-Deal corpus creation

Word cloud generation for pattern discovery

Insights on pitch language and structure influencing investment success

üõ† Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (for ML models)

Seaborn, Matplotlib (for visualization)

WordCloud, TextBlob (for NLP)

Jupyter Notebooks

üìà Outcome
Identified public transport as the preferred mode for over 80% of employees

Delivered business insights to improve transport planning

Highlighted key language themes in successful Shark Tank pitches

Demonstrated the power of combining ML + NLP for operational and investment decisions
